What's a WebView :

	* Native App which only renders a WebView widget that loads your web app.

( You can build mobile apps with cross-platform technologies ( like HTML , JS , CSS ) with other technologies , too.
For example React Native and Flutter would be popular alternatives.

RoadMap:
	Angular Refresher -> Ionic Component Basics -> Ionic + Angular -> Building Native Apps with Capacitor -> Debugging Ionic Apps ->
	Navigation & Routing -> Component Overview -> Styling & Theming -> Handling User Input -> Managing State -> Sending Http Requests ->
	Adding Google Maps -> Native Device Features ( Camera, Location ) -> Authentication -> Publishing the Apps -> RoundUp & Next Steps
						
									
		

								Ionic Component Basics
* UI components.
	Core Components Types: 
		1) Output. ( ion-img, ion-badge );
		2) Layout. ( ion-grid , ion-col, ion-list );
		3) Input. ( ion-button, ion-input );

Why Angular + Ionic : 
	1) Complex Logic ( Re-invent the wheel, error prone) ;
	2) State Management ( UI behaves unpredictably );
	3) Routing / Different Pages ( Smart routing is hard );


Angular Components & Ionic Components :
	Angular:
		1) Created by adding @Component() to a class
		2) Use Angular templates -> Angular does the actual DOM rendering
		3) Only isable inside of other Angular components / in an Angular app
	Ionic:
		1) Ships with pre-built components , not editable by you;
		2) Use native web technologies => Web Component specification;
		3) Can be used anywhere , where HTML elements can be used;
